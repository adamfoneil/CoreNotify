This is the command line tool for [CoreNotify](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CoreNotify). Use this to interact with the CoreNotify backend API.

To use CoreNotify you must register your email. You'll receive an API key at `<youremail>`. New accounts are free for 30 days.

```
corenotify register <youremail>
```

If you loose your key, you can retrieve it by running:

```
corenotify resend <youremail>
```

To check your usage over the last 7 days and renewal date:

```
corenotify usage <youremail> <apikey>
```

Note that CoreNotify doesn't have auto-renewal nor any payment integration. If you like the service, please send $5 times the number of months you'd like to [paypal.me/adamosoftware](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/adamosoftware). I will manually extend your account.
